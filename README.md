I assume you have installed [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

So, do not forget to run following commands before trying to build the project:

```
pod update
pod install
```

Also, do not forget to add to the project ***Keys.plist*** file with your [MoviewDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) app key and following structure:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>app_key</key>
    <string>YOUR_APP_KEY_HERE</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
